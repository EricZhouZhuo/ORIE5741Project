They would like to use some other factors except population, income, and mortality to predict the life expectancy. They are using the
data provided by WHO and kaggle which included 20 potential factors. Their objective is using multiple linear or non-linear analysis 
of factors for different countries to identify factors that contribute to extected life expectancy.
One thing I like the proposal is that they separate the proposal into three parts and label each part by specific title. These titles
let the audience easier to know what is the goal of the group and what kind of result to expect.
Another thing I like about their proposal is that unlike tradition dataset, they are trying to investigate some other factors which
affect the life expectancy.
One last thing I like about their proposal is that they provide the data link so I have a chance to look at the data, which enables me
to further understand what their group is going to work on.
One thing I don't like the proposal is that they don't mention what kind of parameters they are going to use, so that I don't have a 
general idea about where their project will go.
Another concern is that they used data from 2000 to 2015, while living condition varies a lot and life expectancy keeps changing. So I
wonder how they can use the datasets have such a long span to predict the life expectancy.
The third thing is that they only list the problems they have, but they don't list how they are going to solve the problem.
I am very interesting in their case and would like to know the result from their team. However, it is unclear about what they will finally 
get from these project. Are they going to have a prediction model or they are going to have a classifier model. I think making it clear will
make this a better proposal.
